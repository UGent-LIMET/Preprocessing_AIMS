# Description: During the pre-processing, During the pre-processing, AIMS data are summarized into a feature matrix. Burn selection, m/z-interpolation, sample merging, feature detection (peak picking) and noise filtering are performed consecutively.
# Input: 
# -	Configuration.R
# -	‘bio’ folder containing TXT files of samples
# Output: 
# -	VariableMetadata.txt
# -	‘Scans’ folder containing plots/files from calculation steps (e.g. TIC chromatogram)
# - The VariableMetadata.txt will also be saved in the Input folder for next steps in the R pipeline.
