##########Frequently got errors##########
#### MAIN ####
Error in setwd(path_R_scripts) : cannot change working directory
= forget to change path of computer, or typing error in folder "R_scripts" (eg. Rscripts)

Error in setwd(path_data_in) : cannot change working directory
= path is correct, problem: projectname wrong (eg written with space), non-existent folder to input (development after source config w wrong name)

Error : cannot allocate vector of size 7.8 Mb
or 
killed during process 
= not enough RAM for R pipeline to compute (probably step annotate from part pre-processing Thermo), increase RAM of Rbox if possible

Not engough space
= hard drive is full, free up space for calculating

Error in file(file, ifelse(append, "a", "w")) : cannot open the connection
= close excel, close other files opened, check path in main.r correct 

Error in file(filename, "r", encoding = encoding): cannot open the connection
Calls: source -> file
In addition: Warning message: In file (filename, "r", encoding = encoding): cannot open file 'configuration.R': No such file or directory
Execution halted
= configuration.r.r extension is wrong, check configuration.r instead of twice suffix .r

(process:5453): Pango-WARNING **: Invalid UTF-8 string passed to pango_layout_set_text()
= created/exported txt can be in wrong format (incorrect UTF-8), copy/paste from txt to txt to solve.


#### PART 1: pre-processing####
REIMS:
Error in quantile.default(TIC_chromatogram$scan_TIC, 0.95) : 
  missing values and NaN's not allowed if 'na.rm' is FALSE
= setting in config: burn vs sample is incorrect, result is frameshift and NA in df

Error in seq.default(1, nrow(matrix_CompIDs_all_threshold), by = 1) : 
  wrong sign in 'by' argument
=1st file was bad chromatogram so skipped, therefore merging 1st append gives NAs. @VM writing this error. solved if remove bad file from p1. todo check ok? 

Error in scans[line=(line1 + lines_info, ] : subscript out of bounds
warning: in fread(...): stopped early on line XX. expected 1 fields but found 1. ...
= wrong/inclomplete read of raw.txt with fread() eg. 616 instead of 1507 elem matrix/large element
= OR files incomplete converted, check size + open if only eg. 30 of 90 scans info present, than check if copied raw file is corrupt/incomplete?
